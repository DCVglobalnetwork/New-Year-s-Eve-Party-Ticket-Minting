## Project Overview

This project is a simple web application where users can mint their ticket for a New Year's Eve party. The smart contract is deployed using **Remix IDE**, and the application uses **Web3.js** to interact with the deployed contract. A countdown timer shows the remaining time until the event, and once the countdown reaches zero, a celebratory message is shown.

---

## Features

- **Mint Your Ticket**: Users can mint their ticket by interacting with the smart contract.
- **Countdown Timer**: A countdown timer displays the time left until New Year's Eve.
- **New Year Message**: Once the countdown hits zero, a celebratory message is shown.

## Contract ABI and Address

To interact with the smart contract, youâ€™ll need the contract address and ABI.

- **Contract Address**: `0x1242bb21938012C59d7bfe05B726E89917fd9718`
- **Contract ABI**: [See the `app.js` file for the ABI](./app.js)

---

## Deploying with Remix

1. **Access Remix IDE:**
    - Visit [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. **Create a New Solidity Contract:**
    - Create a new file in Remix (e.g., `TicketMinter.sol`) and paste your smart contract code.

3. **Compile the Contract:**
    - In the "Solidity Compiler" tab, select the appropriate compiler version (ensure it matches the version used in your code).
    - Click on "Compile TicketMinter.sol".

4. **Deploy the Contract:**
    - In the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, choose an environment (e.g., Injected Web3 for MetaMask).
    - Deploy the contract by clicking the "Deploy" button.

5. **Get the Contract Address:**
    - After deploying, Remix will show the contract address. Copy this address for use in your frontend application.

6. **Interact with the Contract:**
    - After deployment, you can interact with the contract functions from Remix's "Deployed Contracts" section.
